#Create a function that given a list which represents
 #street lights given as a parameter(l_street), 
 #determine if an outage has occurred. A street 
 #with a total number of “F” greater than or equal 
 #to 2 returns “Outage”, anything below returns 
# “Power”
#Example Input: [ ‘T’, ‘F’, ‘F’, ‘F’ ]				
#Example Output: “Outage”
